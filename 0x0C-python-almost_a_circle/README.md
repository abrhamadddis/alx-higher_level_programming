### 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

# General

* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function

# Requirements

* Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
* All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
